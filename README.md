# R
## Course 1: 94-842 Programming R for Analytics
### Instructor: Mike Blackhurst

Course description:
   
The volume, variety, and velocity of machine-readable data are increasing and, in turn, data are progressively informing decisions made by individuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments. R is a free computing environment and programming language designed specifically for data science that has significantly grown in user base, capability, and end use applications. The purpose of this course is to develop basic, foundational data science methods and R programming skills that can prepare students for a variety of career paths involving analytics.

## Course 2: 95-845 Applied Analytics: the Machine Learning Pipeline
### Instructor: Jeremy C. Weiss

Course description:

Machine learning is a highly valued set of analytics techniques, a confluence of ideas from computer science, statistics, economics, physics, and others. Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities, ways of understanding and visualizing data, and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However, knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data, machine learning, and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights.

The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole.

Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructed data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each.
